cb_websocket_controller
=======================

A template for implementing a Websocket controller for ChicagoBoss

Copy myapp_myapp_protocol_websocket.erl to the src/websocket
directory in your ChicagoBoss project.  Then rename it and start
hacking.

This template is a re-working of the Websocket controller from the
draw application (https://github.com/mihawk/draw)
by chan sisowath (mihawk) at https://github.com/mihawk).
Thanks to chan for that.
